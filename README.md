# AI-Studio-Project

## Project Overview

## Community Building
We utilized BERT, a natural language processor, to create our own model.The model was trained using publicly available data from community organizations and nonprofits nationwide.

## Objective and Goals
- Connecting Students to Community Partners
- Created a community partner model to help match students with organizations and individuals who can offer innovative experiences with real-world challenges.

## Insights and Key Findings
We applied machine learning skills to real world problems and researched different models and their usages. We also encountered challenges that help taught us new ideas and key findings. 

## Potential Next Steps
- A potential next step would be to create an automated code to periodically update datasets with new updated IRS data and which overall simplifies the data cleaniing and colllection process.
- Another next step would be to make data remotely to help take up less space.
